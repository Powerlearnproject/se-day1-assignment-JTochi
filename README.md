#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.


Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It is a systematic and disciplined approach to software development that aims to create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software. 


In the technology industry, it is important in order to develop reliable, efficient, and scalable software solutions to meet the needs of users and businesses effectively.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


In the 1960s and 1970s, the field of software engineering began to take shape. Researchers and practitioners began to develop formal methods for software design and development, such as structured programming and the use of flowcharts to represent algorithms. In 1968, a conference on software engineering was held, and the term “software engineering” was officially coined.

The introduction of object-oriented programming in the 1980s led to a shift in how software was designed and developed.

The 1990s saw the emergence of the Agile software development methodologies, which emphasized flexibility and responsiveness to change. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) has several phases, including:

Planning: The first phase, where the team sets goals, identifies risks, and brainstorms. This phase involves gathering inputs from customers, the sales sector, and market surveys. 

Design: The software specification document created in the analysis phase is used to create a detailed design of the software. This includes creating the front-end features of the application, such as the user interface, templates, and colour palettes. 

Implementation: The design concepts and diagrams are turned into code that can run in a computer system. 

Testing: The software is tested against the requirements to ensure that it solves the needs outlined in the planning phase. 

Deployment: The application is made available to users. 

Maintenance: Bugs that were not discovered during testing are reported and fixed. This can be done as a hotfix or as a regular software update. 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Agile operates on iterative progress through small, manageable units of work and it is ideal for dynamic environments and continuous improvement initiatives. The most popular and common examples of agile are scrum, extreme programming (XP), feature driven development (FDD), dynamic systems development method (DSDM), adaptive software development (ASD), Crystal, and lean software development (LSD).

Waterfall adopts a linear and sequential approach, where each project phase must be completed before the next one begins. It is preferable for projects with well-defined requirements and strict deadlines.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A Software Developer: They’re responsible for turning the product’s architecture and design into a working product.

A Quality Assurance Engineer: The Quality Assurance Engineer is responsible for creating and performing tests, identifying errors, and providing feedback to verify that a final product meets a company’s quality requirements.

A Project Manager: The role of a project manager in a development team is to provide critical guidance, coordinate activities, and manage the software project.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application. Just as writers use text editors and accountants use spreadsheets, software developers use IDEs to make their job easier. Examples are: NetBeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Visual Studio.

Version control systems let you track file changes and access specific versions when needed. It helps developers collaborate and is essential to any successful software project. Examples are:

Local VCS: Stores changes in local files. Risky due to a single point of failure.

Centralized VCS (e.g., SVN): A single, central server hosts the full version history. Fast and straightforward but vulnerable to server failure.

Distributed VCS (e.g., Git, Mercurial): Every user has a complete copy of the repository. Robust against failures, supports flexible workflows.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Some common challenges faced by software engineers are:

Unclear Software Requirements: This challenge can be overcome by defining the project — from vision to expected outcome.

Lack of Communication & Collaboration: This challenge can be overcome by frequent meetings and clear communication channels.

Poor Code Quality and Bugs: This challenge can be overcome by automating the processes and incorporating CI/CD in workflows.

Unrealistic Timelines: This challenge can be overcome by accurate time estimation.

Unrealistic Budget Estimate: This challenge can be overcome by setting the right expectations and define your MVP.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


The four levels of software testing are unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing: 

Unit testing: The first level of testing, which verifies that software components work as intended. Unit testing is important because it helps identify and fix bugs early in development, which can reduce costs and time to market. 

Integration testing: The second level of testing, which verifies data flow between modules. Integration testing exposes faults in the interaction between integrated units. 

System testing: The third level of testing, which examines both functional and non-functional requirements. System testing is performed in a real-life environment to ensure that the system meets business requirements. 

Acceptance testing: The fourth level of testing, which verifies that the requirements have been met. Acceptance testing is performed before the product goes live to help the customer evaluate the results. 

The importance of software testing in software quality assurance:

Software testing is important in software quality assurance because it helps identify and fix bugs before the product is launched. This ensures that only quality products are distributed to consumers, which can improve customer satisfaction and trust.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of giving instructions to a generative AI to produce requested results. 

Its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering describes creating and refining prompts to ensure the AI generates usable and meaningful content. Upon reinterpretation, the cycle ensures that the AI models respond appropriately to a wide range of user input. Ultimately, it may help strengthen the customer experience.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

An example of a vague prompt: “Tell me everything about…”

An improvement in the prompt: “Tell me what materials are needed to build a 3-bedroom house".

The improved prompt is more effective because it clear, specific, and concise.
